## Activities
- Gregorian choir/singing classes - If you're christian or interested in serving/singing, most choirs will be happy to accept new members even if you don't have vocal experience _(or don't usually sing in the shower ðŸ˜‰)_. Singing in latin can help with speaking correctly, being present in the moment, reading and trying to translate or searching for translations to understand the lyrics, lung capacity and breathing and expressing yourself. It also helps you get over that fear of saying latin words out loud without thinking they sound like dark magic spells. ðŸª„

Cambridge Latin Course is also highly regarded. It moves slower and covers less
than LLPSI, but tells a more informative story:

## Format Attribution

I have used the [Yarik Voronoy's Awesome English repository](https://github.com/yvoronoy/awesome-english) as a starter for creating this list. The readability of his style and organization on the list was thorough and wise. I wished to have the same format on mine, while also giving him visibility and thanks for this list style. ðŸ˜„
