## Format Attribution

I have used the [Yarik Voronoy's Awesome English repository](https://github.com/yvoronoy/awesome-english) as a starter for creating this list. The readability of his style and organization on the list was thorough and wise. I wished to have the same format on mine, while also giving him visibility and thanks for this list style. ðŸ˜„
